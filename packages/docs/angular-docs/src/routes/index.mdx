QUI is a collection of high-quality, reusable UI components that can be used to build beautiful and responsive web applications.

Here's what you can expect:

- A wide range of stable components including menus, buttons, form controls, and more
- An Angular-first solution without compromises. Built with directives, components, shared services, and simple CSS for a seamless developer experience
- Styles based on Qualcomm Design System (QDS), an enterprise-vetted component set that defines Qualcomm's visual identity
- Each component is thoroughly tested and extensively documented
- [Full Zoneless support](https://angular.dev/guide/zoneless)
- SSR-compatible by default.

Get started by [installing the packages](./installation).

## Demos

Every component is documented with examples. These examples use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for layout. None of the components rely on Tailwind internally, so don't worry if you aren't using it in your project.

## Styles

The available components are relatively finalized, but minor style updates may happen in the near future as the design system is fully realized. This upgrade process is automatic: when available, update your project's dependencies to the new version of this library.
