This page contains recommendations for working with Angular forms, as well as common pitfalls you might encounter.

This guide is a work in progress.

## Avoiding Pitfalls

### Disabled Attribute

When using Reactive Forms, the `disabled` HTML attribute works differently than it does with template-driven forms.

In short, the FormControl handles its own disabled state internally and will **override the disabled attribute supplied to the HTML attribute**. Consider the following example:

<QdsDemo name="FormDisabledDemo" expanded />

Even though we're setting the input element's `disabled` attribute to `true`, the input is still enabled. This is because the Reactive Form control is the single source of truth for the form's state.

Let's look at another example. Here, we're disabling the control using the FormControl, but we're also setting `[disabled]="false"` in the template.

<QdsDemo name="FormEnabledDemo" expanded />

You'll notice that the input field is disabled, and this is expected. The FormControl is the single source of truth for the form's state, so it overrides the HTML disabled attribute.

> **Note** If you try to do this in your code, Angular will emit a warning message to your browser's dev console. Keep an eye on your console during development for helpful indicators like this one.
