# {frontmatter.title}

This library requires Angular ^20

There are three steps to installation:

1. Install the npm packages
2. Import the CSS
3. Inject the theme service (and optionally change the default theme)

Soon we'll provide pre-built templates for quick starting new projects.

For now, continue reading to learn how to install manually.

## 1. Install the npm packages

<NpmInstallTabs
  packages={[
    "@qualcomm-ui/angular",
    "@qualcomm-ui/angular-core",
    "@qualcomm-ui/core",
    "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core",
    "@qualcomm-ui/dom",
    "@qualcomm-ui/utils",
  ]}
/>

## Import the CSS

> [!tip/Tailwind]
> If you're using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), skip this step and refer to our Tailwind integration instead.

In your application's global CSS file, import the QUI CSS for the theme you're targeting.

```css
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/styles/components.css";
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-dark.css";
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-light.css";
```

Learn more about the available themes in the [theme documentation](/theming/overview).

### Angular SSR

If you're using `@angular/ssr`, you'll need to register the theme provider at the root of your application.

```angular-ts
// app.config.server.ts
import {ApplicationConfig, mergeApplicationConfig} from "@angular/core"
import {provideServerRendering, withRoutes} from "@angular/ssr"

import {provideQdsTheme} from "@qualcomm-ui/angular/theme"

import {appConfig} from "./app.config"
import {serverRoutes} from "./app.routes.server"

const serverConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideServerRendering(withRoutes(serverRoutes)),
    provideQdsTheme(),
  ],
}

export const config = mergeApplicationConfig(appConfig, serverConfig)
```

You'll also need to opt into full server-side rendering (not pre-rendering) in your route config:

```angular-ts
import {RenderMode, ServerRoute} from "@angular/ssr"

export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: "**",
    // this ensures that the cookie-based theme storage is available on the initial render.
    renderMode: RenderMode.Server,
  },
]
```
