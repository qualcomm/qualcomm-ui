# {frontmatter.title}

There are three steps to installation:

1. Install the npm packages
2. Import the CSS
3. Inject the theme service (and optionally change the default theme)

If you'd like to skip all of that, you can use one of our pre-built templates:

- Angular web CSR
- Angular web SSR
- Angular Electron

Otherwise, continue reading to learn how to install manually.

## Install the packages

TODO: add

## Import the CSS

in your application's global CSS file, import the QUI CSS for the theme you're targeting.
