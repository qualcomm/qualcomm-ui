## Overview

Angular component inputs aren't ideal with booleans. In HTML, `<button disabled>` disables the button. So does `<button disabled="true">`. Angular inputs don't work like this by default, but they can be coerced:

```angular-ts
import {Component, input, booleanAttribute} from "@angular/core"
import type {Booleanish} from "@qualcomm-ui/utils/coercion"

@Component(/*...*/)
export class AppToggle {
  readonly open = input<boolean | undefined, Booleanish>(undefined, {
    transform: booleanAttribute,
  })
}
```

The `booleanAttribute` transform makes the input property behave like HTML, and the `Booleanish` type ensures type safety in the template.

```ts
type Booleanish = boolean | "true" | "false" | "" | undefined
```

## Examples

```angular2html
<!-- with the above coercion, the following evaluate to true -->
<app-toggle open />
<app-toggle open="" />
<app-toggle open="true" />
<app-toggle [open]="true" />
```

```angular2html
<!-- with the above coercion, the following evaluate to false -->
<app-toggle open="false" />
<app-toggle [open]="false" />
```
