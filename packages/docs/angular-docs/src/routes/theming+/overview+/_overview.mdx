## Styling with CSS Variables

QUI Components use [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) for properties like `color`, `background-color`, and `border-color`. Instead of hardcoded values, components reference variables that change based on the active brand and theme.

- Three brands are available: `qualcomm`, `snapdragon`, and `dragonwing`.
- Each brand supports both a `light` and `dark` theme.

The CSS is built to enable dynamic switching without rebuilding.

::: spoiler Applying the Data Attributes Manually

If you need to apply the theme data attributes manually instead of using `QdsThemeService`:

- Pick a DOM element (typically `html` or `body`)
- Apply the brand: `data-brand="qualcomm"` (or `snapdragon` / `dragonwing`)
- Apply the theme: `data-theme="dark"` or `data-theme="light"`

Example:

```html
<html data-brand="qualcomm" data-theme="dark">
  <!-- the rest of your app -->
</html>
```

All descendants inherit that theme unless overridden by a closer parent.

> [!warning/Both attributes are required]
> You must apply both the `data-brand` and `data-theme` attributes to the element in order for the theme to take effect.

## Switching the Theme at Runtime

You can switch the theme at runtime using the `QdsThemeService`:

<QdsDemo name="ThemeSwitchingDemo" />

## Force a Specific Theme on a Subtree

The following example shows how to enforce a specific theme on a subtree. You must apply both the `data-brand` and `data-theme` attributes to the element in order for the theme to take effect.

<QdsDemo name="ForceThemeDemo" />
