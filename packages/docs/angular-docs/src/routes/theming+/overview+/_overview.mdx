## Styling with CSS Variables

QUI Components use [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) for properties like `color`, `background-color`, and `border-color`. Instead of hardcoded values, components reference variables that change based on the active brand and theme.

- Three brands are available: `qualcomm`, `snapdragon`, and `dragonwing`.
- Each brand supports both a `light` and `dark` theme.

## Theme Switching

We've built the CSS to enable dynamic switching without rebuilding.

### Import CSS

First import the theme CSS for your chosen brand. We'll demo with `qualcomm`:

```css
/* This import is always required, regardless of your chosen brand/theme */
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/styles/components.css";

@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-light.css";
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-dark.css";
```

If you're using Tailwind, you should import the theme CSS at the `components` layer instead:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

/* Important: always order these imports after the tailwindcss import */
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/styles/components.css" layer(components);
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-light.css" layer(components);
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-dark.css" layer(components);
```

### Apply Data Attributes

In order for the theme to take effect, you must apply the brand and theme to the root element of your application.

This process is handled automatically when you inject the `QdsThemeService`.

```angular-ts
// app.component.ts
import {Component, inject} from "@angular/core"
import {RouterOutlet} from "@angular/router"

import {QdsThemeService} from "@qualcomm-ui/angular/theme"

@Component({
  imports: [RouterOutlet],
  selector: "app-root",
  template: `
    <router-outlet />
  `,
})
export class App {
  protected readonly themeService = inject(QdsThemeService)
}
```

::: spoiler Applying the Data Attributes Manually

- Pick a DOM element. This is typically `html` or `body`.
- Apply the brand to the element using the brand data attribute: `data-brand="qualcomm"` (or `snapdragon` / `dragonwing`).
- Apply `data-theme="dark"` or `data-theme="light"` to the element.

Example:

```html
<html data-brand="qualcomm" data-theme="dark">
  <!-- the rest of your app -->
</html>
```

All descendants of this subtree inherit that theme unless overridden by a closer parent.

> [!warning/Both attributes are required]
> You must apply both the `data-brand` and `data-theme` attributes to the element in order for the theme to take effect.

## Switching the Theme at Runtime

You can switch the theme at runtime using the `QdsThemeService`:

<QdsDemo name="ThemeSwitchingDemo" />

## Force a Specific Theme on a Subtree

The following example shows how to enforce a specific theme on a subtree. You must apply both the `data-brand` and `data-theme` attributes to the element in order for the theme to take effect.

<QdsDemo name="ForceThemeDemo" />
