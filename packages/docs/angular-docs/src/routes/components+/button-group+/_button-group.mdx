## Usage

Use the `q-button-group` directive to group related buttons together. This helps to visually associate buttons that perform similar actions.

## Examples

### Shared Props

When you set certain props on the `q-button-group`, they are automatically applied to all child buttons. Some of these props can be overridden at the button level, while others cannot:

**Non-overridable:**

- [density](./#density), [disabled](./#disabled), and [size](./#size): if set on the group, all buttons will have the same corresponding property. The same prop on individual buttons will be ignored.

**Overridable:**

- [emphasis](./#emphasis) and [variant](./#variant): If set on the group, these will be the default for all buttons, but individual buttons can override them as needed.

<QdsDemo name="ButtonGroupSharedPropsDemo" />

### Layout

Use the [layout](./#layout-1) prop to control how the button group is sized and aligned within its container. Options include:

- `hug`: Content-sized; width matches the buttons only (default).
- `start`: Full width; buttons are aligned to the start edge.
- `end`: Full width; buttons are aligned to the end edge.
- `fill`: Full width; buttons share space evenly.

Borders have been added to the example below to better illustrate these layout options.

<QdsDemo name="ButtonGroupLayoutDemo" />

## Accessibility

You should provide a meaningful label for the button group using either the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute.
