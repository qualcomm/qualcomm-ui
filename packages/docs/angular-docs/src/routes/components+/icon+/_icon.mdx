An icon is a small visual element, like a symbol, that represents certain functions, features, or types of content within a user interface.

```typescript
import {Icon} from "@qualcomm-ui/react/icon"
```

## Overview

QUI components use icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/), an open-source fork of Feather Icons.

Many components like the [Button](/components/button/button), [Icon Button](/components/button/icon-button), and [Text Input](/components/input/text-input) have built-in support for Lucide Icons.

## Examples

### Provider

Use the `provideIcons` utility function to register icons. Provided icons are matched by their string name.

<QdsDemo name="IconProviderDemo" expanded />

### Sizes

Size can be customized using the [size](./#size) input. There are five available values: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`. Should you need more control over the rendered size, supply a number instead which will be converted to pixels.

<QdsDemo name="IconSizesDemo" />

## API

### svg\[qIcon\]

The properties of the `<svg>` element also apply.

<TypeDocProps name="IconDirective" />
