## Guide

By default, columns are ordered in the order they are defined in the `columns` array. You can manually specify the column order using the `columnOrder` state. Other features like column pinning and grouping can also affect the column order.

### What Affects Column Order

There are 3 table features that can reorder columns, which happen in the following order:

1. [Column Pinning](/feature-guides/column-pinning) – If pinning, columns are split into left, center (unpinned), and right pinned columns.
2. Manual **Column Ordering—**A manually specified column order is applied.
3. [Grouping](/feature-guides/column-grouping) – If grouping is enabled, a grouping state is active, and `tableOptions.groupedColumnMode` is set to `'reorder' | 'remove'`, then the grouped columns are reordered to the start of the column flow.

> **Note:** `columnOrder` state will only affect unpinned columns if used in conjunction with column pinning.

### Column Order State

If you don't provide a `columnOrder` state, QUI Table will just use the order of the columns in the `columns` array. However, you can provide an array of string column ids to the `columnOrder` state to specify the order of the columns.

#### Default Column Order

If all you need to do is specify the initial column order, you can just specify the `columnOrder` state in the `initialState` table option.

```tsx
const table = useReactTable({
  initialState: {
    columnOrder: ["columnId1", "columnId2", "columnId3"],
  },
  // ...
})
```

> **Note:** If you are using the `state` table option to also specify the `columnOrder` state, the `initialState` will have no effect. Only specify particular states in either `initialState` or `state`, not both.

#### Managing Column Order State

If you need to change the column order, or set the column order after the table has been initialized, you can manage the `columnOrder` state:

```tsx
const [columnOrder, setColumnOrder] = useState<string[]>([
  "columnId1",
  "columnId2",
  "columnId3",
])

const table = useReactTable({
  state: {
    columnOrder,
  },
  onColumnOrderChange: setColumnOrder,
  // ...
})
```

#### Drag and Drop Column Reordering Suggestions

There are several ways to implement drag and drop features with QUI Table. Here are recommendations to guide your implementation:

1. Avoid using [`react-dnd`](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/overview). This is no longer maintained.

2. Use [`@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop`](https://github.com/atlassian/pragmatic-drag-and-drop). It's a lightweight, performant, and accessible drag and drop library.
