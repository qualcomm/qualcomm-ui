# {frontmatter.title}

Server-side pagination demo with a simulated backend API. Pagination state is managed explicitly in the component. This is the standard approach for backend integrations. See the [Pagination Guide](/feature-guides/pagination) for implementation details.

<Demo
  expanded
  name="PaginationControlledDemo"
  component={demos.PaginationControlledDemo}
/>
