The Column types are organized by feature. All feature types are ultimately joined in the single `Column` type definition.

## API

### CoreColumn

Basic column properties available on all columns regardless of features enabled. Includes column identification (id), hierarchy information (depth, parent), and references to associated rows and column definitions.

<TypeDocProps partial name="CoreColumn" />

### FiltersColumn

Properties and methods for filtering column data. Provides access to filter functions, filter values, and methods to apply or clear filters. See the [Column Filtering](/feature-guides/column-filtering) guide for implementation details.

<TypeDocProps partial name="FiltersColumn" />

### SortingColumn

Properties and methods for controlling column sort behavior. Includes sort direction state, sort functions, and methods to toggle or clear sorting. See the [Sorting](/feature-guides/sorting) guide for implementation details.

<TypeDocProps partial name="SortingColumn" />

### GroupingColumn

Properties and methods for grouping rows by column values and aggregating grouped data. Provides access to aggregation functions, grouped row state, and methods to toggle grouping. See the [Grouping](/feature-guides/grouping) guide for implementation details.

#### AggregationFn

The `AggregationFn` interface is used on several of the `GroupingColumn` properties.

```typescript
export type AggregationFn<TData extends RowData> = (
  columnId: string,
  leafRows: Row<TData>[],
  childRows: Row<TData>[],
) => any
```

<TypeDocProps partial name="GroupingColumn" />

### VisibilityColumn

Properties and methods for controlling column visibility state. Provides methods to show, hide, or toggle column visibility. See the [Column Visibility](/feature-guides/column-visibility) guide for implementation details.

<TypeDocProps partial name="VisibilityColumn" />

### ColumnPinningColumn

Properties and methods for pinning columns to the left or right side of the table. Includes pinning state and methods to pin or unpin columns. See the [Column Pinning](/feature-guides/column-pinning) guide for implementation details.

<TypeDocProps partial name="ColumnPinningColumn" />

### ColumnSizingColumn

Properties and methods for managing column width and resizing behavior. Includes current size, min/max constraints, and methods to set or reset column dimensions. See the [Column Sizing](/feature-guides/column-sizing) guide for implementation details.

<TypeDocProps partial name="ColumnSizingColumn" />
