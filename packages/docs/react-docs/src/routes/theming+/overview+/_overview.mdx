##### 1. Component Styles and CSS Variables

- Most of our components rely on [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) for their styling.
- These variables serve as placeholders for common properties like `color`, `background-color`, and `border-color`.
- Instead of hardcoding specific values for these properties, we reference the CSS variables.

##### 2. Dynamic Theme Switching

- The `@qualcomm-ui/styles` package includes both light and dark theme styles. This allows our websites to seamlessly switch between these themes without requiring a complete rebuild.
- When the user selects a theme (light or dark), we dynamically update the values of the CSS variables.
  - For example, if the active theme is dark, we adjust the variables to match the dark color scheme.

This approach allows us to define the component's CSS rules once, and the theme-specific adjustments happen automatically based on the active theme.

## Theme Switching

Theme switching is accomplished by applying either the `data-theme="dark"` or `data-theme="light"` attribute to an element in your DOM tree. The active theme for a subtree of elements is based on the presence of the attribute on the closest parent element. We recommend the root element that wraps your entire application, like `<html>`.
