## Styling with CSS Variables

QUI Components use [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) for properties like `color`, `background-color`, and `border-color`. Instead of hardcoded values, components reference variables that change based on the active theme.

## Available Brands and Themes

Three brands are available: `qualcomm`, `snapdragon`, and `dragonwing`.

Each brand supports both a `light` and `dark` theme.

## Theme Switching

We've built the CSS to enable dynamic switching without rebuilding.

### Import CSS

First import the theme CSS for your chosen brand. We'll demo with `qualcomm`:

```css
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-light.css";
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-dark.css";
```

If you're using Tailwind, you should import the theme CSS at the `components` layer instead:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-light.css" layer(components);
@import "@qualcomm-ui/qds-core/themes/qualcomm-dark.css" layer(components);
```

### Apply Data Attributes

- Pick a DOM element. This is typically `html` or `body`.
- Apply the brand to the element using the brand data attribute: `data-brand="qualcomm"` (or snapdragon / dragonwing).
- Apply `data-theme="dark"` or `data-theme="light"` to the element.

Example:

```html
<html data-brand="qualcomm" data-theme="dark">
  <!-- the rest of your app -->
</html>
```

All descendants of this subtree inherit that theme unless overridden by a closer parent.

> [!warning/Both attributes are required]
> You must apply both the `data-brand` and `data-theme` attributes to the element in order for the theme to take effect.

### Enforce a Specific Theme

The following example shows how to enforce a specific theme on a subtree.

<QdsDemo name="OverviewTheme" />
