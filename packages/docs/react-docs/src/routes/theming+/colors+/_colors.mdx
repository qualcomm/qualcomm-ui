If you're using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), you can install the [@qualcomm-ui/tailwind-plugin](/integrations/tailwind) package to make each of these variables available as Tailwind classes.

### Semantic

Semantic colors are commonly used to convey a specific status to the user.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.semantic} />

### Text

Black text inverts to white when switched to dark mode. Text link and error tokens change to a lighter shade to ensure that small text has a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 or greater when used on a dark background.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.text} />

### Background

Backgrounds are commonly used as colors for your app's surfaces, such as cards, pages, and menus.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.background} />

### Foreground

Similar to text color tokens, foreground token colors invert when switched to dark mode. Foreground colors are mainly used for black & white icons but can be used for illustrations or any graphical elements that should invert when toggled between modes.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.foreground} />

### Borders

Borders are lines that bring clarity to a layout by grouping and dividing content. They are used to divide text or components such as table rows, action button groups, and components within a panel.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.border} />
