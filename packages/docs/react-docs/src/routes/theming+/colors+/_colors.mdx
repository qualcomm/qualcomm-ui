### Text

Text colors are used for typography throughout your application. They automatically adapt when switching between light and dark modes to maintain proper contrast ratios.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.text} />

### Icon

Icon colors ensure proper visual hierarchy and accessibility for icons. Like text colors, they automatically adjust for light and dark modes.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.icon} />

### Background

Background colors include brand, neutral, and support colors. They are commonly used as colors for your app's surfaces, cards, and UI elements.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.background} />

### Surface

Surface colors are used for primary application surfaces like pages, modals, and overlays.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.surface} />

### Border

Border colors bring clarity to layouts by grouping and dividing content. They are used to divide text or components such as table rows, action button groups, and components within a panel.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.border} />

### Category

Category colors provide a palette for data visualization and content categorization. Each category has three variants: subtle, medium, and strong.

<ColorTable data={themeColors.category} />
