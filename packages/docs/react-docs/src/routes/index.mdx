QUI is a collection of high-quality, reusable UI components that can be used to build beautiful and responsive web applications.

Here's what you can expect:

- A pure React solution without compromise. Built with function components, hooks, context, and simple CSS for a performant and seamless developer experience
- Accessible by default. Built with [WAI-ARIA authoring patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)
- Styles based on Qualcomm Design System (QDS) which defines Qualcomm's unique visual identity
- Hassle-free SSR by default (this site is serverside-rendered, including every demo and example). Use with Next.js, React Router, Tanstack Start, Vite, and more
- [Polymorphic components](/polymorphic-components) for ultimate framework compatibility
- Bundled with React Compiler support
- Themeable with a robust design token architecture
- Each update is documented in our [changelog](/changelogs/react)

Get started by [installing the packages](/installation).

## Demos

Component demos use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for layout. None of the components rely on Tailwind internally, so don't worry if you aren't using it in your project.
