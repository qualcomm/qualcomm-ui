A switch is a simple, two-option control that can be toggled between two states — on and off. It's commonly used in settings or preferences menus where users can enable or disable features.

```tsx
import {Switch} from "@qualcomm-ui/react/switch"
```

## Examples

### Simple

Basic switch using the simple API with a label.

<QdsDemo name="SwitchSimpleDemo" />

### Composite

Build with the composite API for granular control. This API requires you to provide each subcomponent, but gives you full control over the structure and layout.

<QdsDemo name="SwitchCompositeLayoutDemo" />

### States

Based on the inputs, the switch will render as checked or unchecked.

<QdsDemo name="SwitchStatesDemo" />

### Disabled State

When [disabled](./#disabled) is true, the switch becomes non-interactive and is rendered with reduced opacity to indicate its unavailable state.

<QdsDemo name="SwitchDisabledDemo" />

### Sizes

Use the [size](./#size) prop to change the size of the switch.

<QdsDemo name="SwitchSizesDemo" />

### Controlled State

Set the initial value using the [defaultChecked](./#defaultChecked) prop, or use [checked](./#checked) and [onCheckedChange](./#onCheckedChange) to control the value manually. These props follow our [controlled state](/patterns/controlled-state) pattern.

<QdsDemo expanded name="SwitchControlledDemo" />

## Forms

Choose the form library that fits your needs—we've built examples with React Hook Form and Tanstack Form to get you started.

### React Hook Form

Use [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) to handle the switch state and validation. [ArkType](https://arktype.io/) works great for schema validation if you need it.

<QdsDemo expanded name="SwitchReactHookFormDemo" />

### Tanstack Form

[Tanstack Form](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/basic-concepts) handles switch validation with its built-in validators.

<QdsDemo expanded name="SwitchTanstackFormDemo" />

Tanstack form also supports [ArkType](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/validation#validation-through-schema-libraries).

## Composite Guidelines

The composite elements are only intended to be used as direct descendants of the `<Switch.Root>` component.

```tsx
/* Won't work alone ❌ */
<Switch.HiddenInput />
<Switch.Control />

/* Works as expected ✅ */
<Switch.Root>
  <Switch.HiddenInput />
  <Switch.Control />
</Switch.Root>
```

## Shortcuts

### Control and Thumb

The switch control automatically renders the thumb if no child elements are supplied. This:

```tsx
<Switch.Control />
```

is equivalent to this:

```tsx
<Switch.Control>
  <Switch.Thumb />
</Switch.Control>
```

## API

### \<Switch.Root\>

<TypeDocProps name="SwitchRootProps" />

### \<Switch\>

The `Switch` component supports all props from [Switch.Root](./#switchroot), plus the additional props listed below.

<TypeDocProps name="SwitchProps" omitFrom="SwitchRootProps" />
