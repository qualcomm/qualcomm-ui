# {frontmatter.title}

Page data is defined in the config's [navConfig](/api/qui-docs-config#navConfig) field. Properties for this field are documented here.

> [!warning]
> Several of these properties overlap with properties on the page's Frontmatter. Properties defined on the NavConfig take precedence over properties defined on each page's Frontmatter.

The `NavConfig` type is a union of two types:

```tsx
export type NavConfig = RouteMeta | NavMeta
```

## API

### RouteMeta

Metadata that describes a route.

<TypeDocProps name="RouteMeta" />

### NavMeta

Metadata describing a nav item without an associated route. These entries are used to render separators or section titles between other nav items.

Note that this is currently limited to top-level nav items (not supported in children).

<TypeDocProps name="NavMeta" />
