This can give you an idea of how widely used and maintained the packages are: In general, packages with more adoption see more maintenance because the community is larger. More downloads indicate more popularity and usage of a package, which may in turn motivate the developers to maintain and update it more frequently and consistently. Another way to look at it is that more downloads reflect more demand and expectations from the users, which may increase the pressure and responsibility for the developers to maintain and improve the package. While this is not always the case, downloads are generally a good metric to keep in mind.","heading":"Check the Popularity","headingLevel":3,"href":"/best-practices/choosing-dependencies#check-the-popularity"},{"categories":["Best Practices","Choosing Dependencies"],"id":"/pages/best-practices/choosing-dependencies.mdx-2","pathSegments":["best-practices","choosing-dependencies"],"pathname":"/best-practices/choosing-dependencies","title":"Choosing Dependencies","content":"Check for the most recent issues that describe potential shortcomings or problems.

I like to think of it like this: Ask yourself if you would be content with including the package’s code as-is in your codebase. If the answer is no, then you might want to reconsider including the package at all. Consider the worst-case scenario: if this package is no longer maintained in the future, but your project still depends on it, would you be able to fork the code and update it yourself?","heading":"Evaluate the Code Quality","headingLevel":3,"href":"/best-practices/choosing-dependencies#evaluate-the-code-quality"},{"categories":["Best Practices","Choosing Dependencies"],"id":"/pages/best-practices/choosing-dependencies.mdx-4","pathSegments":["best-practices","choosing-dependencies"],"pathname":"/best-practices/choosing-dependencies","title":"Choosing Dependencies","content":"Check for similar packages and see if they offer better or similar solutions to your problem.
